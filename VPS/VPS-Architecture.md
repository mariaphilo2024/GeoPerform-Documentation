## 1. Data Sources
The system collects data from four main sources:
- **Vessel Data** – Raw operational data from vessels.  
- **Performance Data** – Historical and real-time performance data.  
- **Weather Data** – Weather conditions affecting vessel operations.  
- **AIS Data** – Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for vessel location and movement tracking.  

---

## 2. Data Processing Components
### ✅ Email Reader Service  
- Collects data (e.g., vessel reports) from emails.  
- Extracts key data points and sends them to the VPS database.  

### ✅ GeoForms Ingestion Engine  
- Processes structured data received from GeoForms.  
- Maps data to predefined fields and stores it in the VPS database.  

---

## 3. VPS Database
- Central storage for all ingested and processed data.  
- Handles both structured and unstructured data.  

---

## 4. Data Flow
- **Raw data** from vessels → Email Reader Service → VPS Database  
- **Performance data** → Stored in VPS Database  
- **Weather information** → GeoForms Ingestion Engine → VPS Database  
- **Location data** from AIS → VPS Database  
- **Processed data** → Stored in VPS Database

## 5. Output and Insights
### ✅ Frontend (UI)  
- Displays performance insights and operational data.  
- Accepts user feedback and sends it back to the database.  

### ✅ Analytics Engine  
- Queries data from the VPS database.  
- Generates performance insights and structured reports.  
- Supports predictive analysis and decision-making.  

---

## 6. Feedback Loop
- Performance insights from the Analytics Engine are fed back to the Frontend UI.  
- User feedback is collected and stored for continuous improvement.  

---

## 🏆 Key Highlights:
✔️ Efficient data processing from multiple sources.  
✔️ Real-time performance insights and reporting.  
✔️ Feedback loop ensures continuous improvement.  
✔️ Scalable to handle large volumes of vessel data.
