### **VPS Settings-Document**

### **1. Overview**
The VPS settings page has been restructured and is now categorized into three main sections:
- **Master Pages**
- **User Settings**
- **Alert Settings**

Standard alerts are currently not in use. The settings page now contains **Data Master** and **User** configurations. The current version is displayed prominently on the settings page.

- **Vessel categories include:**
  - **Vessel Type** (Backend-defined, UI integration planned)
  - **Vessel Size** (User-defined in UI)
  - **Vessel Class** (User-defined in UI)
- Vessel types influence calculations in modules like **AER-CII Rating**.

### **Consumption Categories (Consumer Types)**
- Defines fuel consumption categories for passages.
- Includes both predefined and custom categories.
- **New Fuel Types require backend logic updates** in multiple reports and tracking screens.

### **Fuel Types and Dependencies**
- Adding a new fuel type requires updates in:
  - **Tracking Screen logic**
  - **Vessel Daily Details Report (VDD)**
  - **EUMRV grouping**
- Example: **LFO fuel type** was recently added but required manual backend mapping.
- Fuel type additions do not automatically integrate into system logic and require backend modifications.
- A proposed enhancement is to allow **FO(Fuel Oil) & GO(Gas Oil) category definition from the UI**.

### **Port Master**
- Contains a database of **8,000â€“9,000 ports**.
- Individual ports can be added via the application.
- Bulk additions require backend updates.
- Ports impact **EUMRV logic, passage screen, arrival/departure records**.
